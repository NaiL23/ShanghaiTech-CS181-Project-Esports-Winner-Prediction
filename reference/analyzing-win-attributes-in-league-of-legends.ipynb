It hosts progressional competitions throughout the year and had 43 million viewers in the 2016 World Championships alone.  For context, that's more than the 30.8 million viewers that watched Game 7 of the 2016 NBA finals!  Published by Riot Games, LOL is clearly fun and addictive once you get started.  For those who haven't, here's a quick overview of the game itself.\n","\n","10 players are divided into 2 teams (blue or red) in the main LoL game (there are 3 modes).  The objective for each team is to destroy the opposing teams \"Nexus\".  Think of the Nexus as the main building in a base camp.  Destroy the enemy Nexus and your team wins the game.  Protect yours or your team loses the game.  Simple enough.  However, the collaboration often required between teammates to advance on the enemy Nexus, while defending its own, is wonderfully complex.   \n","\n","![LOL](http://pm1.narvii.com/6029/2a963cd5eb6de5cd1aa53c4f498d1df039a82cf0_hq.jpg)\n","\n","I thought it would be fun to explore this data set and see what team attributes are associated with a team winning.  There's a wealth of data in this file and it seems to be a solid exercise for general data wrangling to start, opportunities for visualizations throughout, and serves as a good primer to build and evaluate models that predict wins. You'll see that we'll touch on what sort of models we might consider, but again this kernel **will not** go through the data consolidation, train, test, split procedures for the **time being**. Still lots of fun and insight ahead though!  \n","\n","Let's dive right in."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7776360f-87a2-4eef-b333-380c2bc3d73a","_uuid":"eb932a8594deda64d99d345c8274051e4f74f544"},"source":["_________________________"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"51a3b25f-eea9-4ae7-bda2-db5681407fc7","_uuid":"a2aabc01edd99d036bcaa08eb7507a71662e04ce"},"source":["*Please note this kernel will be used to guide a small group new to Python and data analysis in how to use the former for the latter.

This plot shows a lot of similar detail as the ECDF (top right) but I feel is slightly more intuitive.  The blue shaded part is known as the IQR (inter quartile range) and each horizontal line of the box represents the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles (bottom to top).  So if we applied an ascending sort to the data in game length and chopped that data in half, the data point at the half would be equivalent to the median or 50th percentile.  Chop the bottom half of the original data split again and that half is the 25th percentile.  Do the same with the top and you have the 75th percentile.  We get a little added context here in seeing the outliers (little dots) a little more blatantly than the ECDF provides so that's helpful.\n","\n","*  **ECDF** (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (top left)).  Here's an insightful way of seeing what percent of the variable data is at or below a particular value.  As the annotations in this first plot show, 25% of the **gamelength** data is at 32 minutes or less.  Move up and to the right of the ECDF and you'll continue to see the Y% of gamelength data that is at or below X minutes.  \n","    * What's worth mentioning from a holistic ECDF view is that a vertically straight line would suggest little variability in the variable (where all game lengths are the same).  \n","    * Conversely, a horizontal ECDF would indicate a lot of variability within the data set.  **This ECDF seems to be relatively standard and lie somewhere in between.**  And we can widen our perspective from the remaining plots.\n","\n","* **Histogram** (bottom right).  The traditional histogram count is on the left y axis and the percentage of all games is on the right y axis.  This immediately shows the most freqent minute value of all competitve LOL games played.  We can see that it is slightly skewed right (tail of the data is longer on the right).  Also another angle on the outlier game lengths around the 60 minute mark.\n","\n","\n","* **Distribution Plot** (bottom left).  This plot is breaking the shape of the histogram on the left down by **Year** although we include the 'All Years' shape for context / verification in blue.  It looks like the game minutes distributions have skewed a bit more right in 2016 and 2017, as the apex of distributions for 2014 an 2015 are a bit further right than 2016 and 2017.  Several reasons could be attributed to the slight distribution shift.  It could be changes in game play strategy to in app purchase behaviors or sample size (2014 had far fewer games).  Nothing starkly different or worth really digging into at this point but maybe good to keep in mind for later model building and test intperetation.

These graphs only tell us how much total gold winning vs losing teams had by minute.  \n","\n","**Minutes 0-19**: At the beginning of a game, the disparity in gold value is naturally pretty low.  Games are just getting started.  But as the minutes pass, it's clear that the difference in interquartile ranges (IQR = boxes, marking the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of a distribution) for teams that win from those that lose really start to separate.  By the 19th minute (colored in blue and red), the 25th percentile (bottom of the IQR) of winning teams is nearly at the 75th percentile for losing teams.  \n","\n","**Minutes 20-39**: This plot is starting to suggest that there is a cumulative advantage in taking actions to accumulate gold early.  We already spoke about how the IQRs really start to separate by the end of thee 19th minute.  Here in the second plot we see that the gold lead dramatically separates itself in minutes 20-39.  It looks like early gold value is a pretty significant factor in determining the likihood of winning at this early stage of analysis.  I'm clearly simplifying the game play a great deal here, but its hard to suggest the contrary.  We'll get a more definitive answer by the end of the notebook.\n","\n","**Minutes 40-59**: Gold disparity begins to shrink.  Are winning teams during this time now more likely focused on other parts of the game?  A greater focus could be made on micromanaging units to destroy enemy structures.  We'll get some more context here when we look at these other attributes.\n","\n","**Minutes 60-80**:  The IQRs here are kind of all over the place.  I somewhat disregard this data as we saw from the earlier **gamelength** plots that an insignificant minority actually reaches this period.  Only about % of games last past the 59th minute, so this entire row is more of an \"eh, who really cares\" subset of data. I'll leave it at that and return to this data if needed later on (although highly unlikely)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4f01a8fd-eed0-4eb2-865e-d3dd2d142abf","_uuid":"1e2b614461dad2eea2556771adb6f6c9c1c54339"},"source":["## Kill Attributes"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"41774332-0b71-4fba-8809-2db43190da45","_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"36af6972f31bbbfa2fafb6bd28656874724886f6"},"outputs":[],"source":["df[['bKills', 'rKills']].head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e42995b1-5b34-41aa-9e23-5450956b31e6","_uuid":"03f29dfce05318d6a73619b88cfaaba522faee12"},"source":["The above shows we're dealing with sublists within lists within a big giant list.

If a team gets 1 kill within the fist 2 minutes of the game, the likelihood of that team winning is roughly 65%.

I'm surprised the slope isn't steeper but I suppose a lot can happen after the first two minutes of the game. The wide 95% confidence interval (light blue shaded) suggests the same.

But I reason this by thinking it's more advantageous to level up in ways other than directly attacking your opponent at the start.
